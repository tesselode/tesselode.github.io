Cocoa Delay is a free, open-source delay plugin in VST format. It focuses on clean design, easy operation, and a warm, lively sound.

Notable features:

- Delay time drift, for giving the wet signal a slight wow/flutter effect
- Adjustable wet level ducking based on the input signal
- Static, ping-pong, and circular pan modes
- Drive section based on open-source Airwindows saturation code
