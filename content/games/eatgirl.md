EAT GIRL is a surreal top-down action game about moving through tight corridors and eating dots.

The atmosphere of the world is sometimes meditative and sometimes unsettling. Each level is accompanied by a unique blend of ambient music.

The game contains at least 30 levels. Skilled players can probably finish every level in 4-5 hours.
