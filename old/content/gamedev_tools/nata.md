Nata is a Lua library for managing entities in games. It allows you to create entity pools, which are containers that hold all the objects in a game, like geometry, characters, and collectibles. At its simplest, pools hold entities and allow you to call functions on them, but they also provide a minimal structure for an Entity Component System organization.
