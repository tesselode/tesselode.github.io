title: Game Design Manifesto

## Create a feeling.
It may seem obvious, but games are most exciting when they make the player feel something they wouldn't normally feel. Every part of the game, from the interaction between the player and the game to the visuals and the audio, should work together to enhance the feeling that the game aims to create.

## Practice empathy.
Games are made by humans, for humans. As with any other artform, your game should aim to enrich the lives of the people playing it. Anything else is immoral.

## Respect the player's time.
Your player could be doing anything, but they're choosing to devote their time to playing your game. Say the thing you want to say as concisely as possible. Don't pad the game with content that doesn't contribute to the main experience - length is not a virtue.

## Prioritize accessibility.
Games are for everyone. Make your game accessible to as many people as possible. There are some things you may not be able to compromise on without fundamentally changing your game, and that's OK, but be cognizant of barriers to people playing your game, and design for accessibility during the entire development process.

## Reject challenge.
Challenge is a tool that can enhance a game's experience, but it's not a virtue in and of itself. Avoid using challenge where it does not enhance the experience. Especially avoid needlessly punishing the player - think carefully before using archaic game design idioms such as lives, game overs, and sparsely placed checkpoints and save points.
