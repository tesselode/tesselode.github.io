	<h1>Colossus Design Doc</h1>
	
	<h2>Synopsis</h2>
	<p>In this 2D platformer Metroidvania, you must explore a desolate world to collect its resources and bring them back to your ship, but you're being hunted by a colossal being who lives on the planet and always knows where you are.</p>

	<h2>Characters</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>The commander</strong> - gives you orders to collect resources and artifacts from this supposedly uninhabited planet. He says it's for the good of humanity.</li>
		<li><strong>The colossus</strong> - the only sentient being on this planet. She is very large (about 10x the size of a human) and somewhat slow, but very powerful. She feels a strong duty to protect her planet, and does not take kindly to people stealing from it. She will try to persuade you not to take anything from the planet, but if you disobey, she will try to kill you.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Gameplay</h2>
	<p>
		This is an open-world platformer where your goal is to collect resources and bring them back to your ship. You can also find tools that you can integrate with your own technology to help you navigate the planet, as well as artifacts that will allow your translator to process the colossus' language.
	</p>
	<p>
		No matter where you are in the world, the colossus will always have a general sense of where you are and will track you down in real time. The only way to stay safe is to move quickly and try to avoid large, open spaces.
	</p>

	<h2>Alternate path</h2>
	<p>
		(I haven't fully thought this through yet)
	</p>
	<p>
		The game will not force you to steal resources from the colossus' planet - it is up to the player to realize there is an alternate path through the game.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you disobey the commander's orders, he will send increasingly large military forces to the planet to force you to obey. You can work with the colossus to fight back against these forces, eventually leading to an alternate ending where you can have a peaceful life with the colossus on the alien planet.
	</p>

	<h2>Specific moments</h2>

	<h3>First encounter with the colossus</h3>
	<p>
		When you first try to take resources from the planet, the colossus will corner you and speak to you in an unknown language, presented as a garbled dialogue box. (You can read the actual dialogue if you've picked up artifacts for your translator by this point). She will not kill you yet - rather, she will talk to you. If you try to leave with the resources, she will grab you and forcefully take the resources back, but she will still not kill you.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can still leave and explore for a while and come back to steal the resources again.
	</p>
	<p>
		After you've stolen one or two resources, she will try to kill you for the rest of the game.
	</p>

	<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
	<p>
		I'm envisioning a Super Metroid-esque aesthetic with SNES chiptunes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The colossus should be a combination of regal, dignified, wheathered by time, intimidating, and beautiful. Beautiful is optional, but I don't want her to be Ugly and Grossâ„¢.
